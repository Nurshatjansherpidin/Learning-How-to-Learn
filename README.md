This course is available through Coursera, you may have direct access through the [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

I would definitely recommend without any hesitation to anyone who is interested in how to learn efficiently, this course is just amazing. It helped me to overcome anxiety in learning, procrastination, to learn some neuroscience, time management etc. I wish I had learned this in earlier period of my life, the earlier you know how your brain functions, the better you know how to cope with difficulties in learning. Mastering the tools covered in the course helps you not only to learn Art & Literature courses like language or music, but also hard science like math or physics. 

In this article, I will cover some concepts mentioned in the course that are inspiring to me and it basically serves as a personal notebook. If you want to know more, definitely check out the course with the link above to learn learning techniques.

## Week 1
#### The Two Modes of Thinking :Diffuse mode and focused mode
Our brain has two modes of thinking, diffuse and focus mode 
Focus mode:
When we tackle analytical and sequential issues, we often use focus mode of thinking.
Diffuse mode: 
when it comes to deal with problems that require creative ways to solve, we use diffuse mode of thinking. Diffuse mode mode of thinking is like roaming in your brain, it helps new neural connections to form in the brain. Have you experienced coming up with an idea while taking a shower? Or after working intensively without result, when you let go, then comes the solution. Yes, that is what we are talking about. Both thinking modes are important in our daily life.

#### How Dali and Edison come up with creative ideas. 
It is very interesting that both of them use the same technique to come up with fantastic ideas. Both would sit on a chair with keys or balls in their hand, and thinking vaguely about what they were thinking but without progress, as they would fall asleep, the keys or the balls in their hands would fall and wake them up, then they would be able to gather the ideas they come up with using the diffuse mode and go back to what they were working on.

#### Practice makes permanent
No matter it is math, physics, language or art, you need to practice to make it stick in your brain. Even though pilots or physicians seem to carry out sophisticated work everyday, but they are not incomprehensible, they also, practiced over time to make them stick.

#### How to use Pomodoro to prevent procrastination 
We will touch on the subject also in week. Procrastination usually is caused by focusing on the product of our work rather than on the process. Set the timer for 25 mins, and avoiding doing other unrelated work during this time, take 5 min of rest after 25 min as a reward and at the same time let mind go off from what you have been working on, to switch it from focus mode to diffuse mode to improve efficiency. After 4 Pomodoro time, give yourself a longer rest.

#### The importance of sleep
Only being awake creates metabolic toxins in your brain, which would hinder your brain from working smoothly, and only when you sleep, your brain can self-clean to stay healthy. Not only do you need to sleep but also need to get enough sleep

#### Working Memory and Long-term Memory, Building lasting memory
Repetition is required to bring what is in the working memory to your long-term memory. Do not repeat over and over again once like working your butt off before the weightlifting contest, you need to build it over time.
Use sofwares like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to memorize everything

#### Some learning tips from [Dr. Terrence Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski)
- Learning by doing
- Active engagement
- Get into enriched environment where you have people around to stimulate new ideas, or do regular exercise
- Exercise helps develop ability to learn and also helps retain memory

## Week 2
> Just wanting to learn and spending a lot of time does not guarantee that you will actually learn it.
#### Chunking 
Chunk is a set of information connected through its meaning, it is like a puzzle where every piece connects to one another to form the whole picture. Chunk makes your brain to work more efficiently and smoothly.
![chunking](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcT5tchn7VVMOSw4yK4ser2S3DfvgFEk7AF5LQ&usqp=CAU)
#### How to form a chunk?
You can use bottom-up and top-down approaches to form chunks. Such as when learning a language, grammar helps you form structures of a language and words help fill the gaps in between.
#### Illusion of Competence
When you think you know it but you actually do not know it. If you do not want to step away from the comfort zone and doing what you already know, you would think you know it all. 
> You are the most easiest person that you could fool.
![illusion of competence](https://soullfire.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/14-dunning-kruger.jpg?w=618)
#### Overlearning
Practicing or learning what you already know, this might be helpful sometimes if you are going to give a public speech to tackle nervousness, but doing so can also be a waste of time. Doing what you deem easy would create illusion of competence. 
![over learning](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uypvJsjZWkU/maxresdefault.jpg)
#### Deliberate Practice 
Instead of overlearning, learning what is easy for you, deliberately doing what you find more difficult, so you would spend your time more efficiently. 
![deliberate practice](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/178e11_aaab3c7004d04cc89a1765965dfb9244~mv2.gif)
#### Einstellung 
An idea or a neural connected that you developed or strengthen might prevent you from forming a better idea.
![einstellung](https://miro.medium.com/max/640/0*903APbPAMLqQ2Lp4.jpg)
#### Interleaving: Best learning Practice
Practicing the subjects you want to master by jumping back and forth using different technique and strategies.

#### Driving deeper into memory
There are some techniques you can use to help things stick in your memory. You can be creative about how to memorize things that suits you, by suing metaphor or analogy, and you need to repetition over time to push them into the long-term memory.
	
## Week 3 
#### The four components of a habit 
- The cue 
The trigger that launches you to a habit
- The routine 
The reaction to the cue 
- The reward 
The reward you get from your reaction
- The belief 
Your underlying belief that habit can be altered or not.
![habit](https://miro.medium.com/max/964/1*At96l1lIgub9wTkiKxkJWg.jpeg)
#### Example: Checking message
- Cue: your phone pushes a notification, that triggers you action to notice it. 
- Routine: you grab your phone and slide up the screen and check your messages without even realizing it.
- Reward: You see the message.
- Belief: It is impossible not to pay attention to the message when studying.

#### Forming or changing the habit
You need to focus on the four components of habit in order to make a change. Spot the cue, change your reaction to the cue and set a reward for yourself and believe that you can overcome procrastination.

#### The formula of procrastination
When you think about the work or the report you want to work on, it does not make you feel good, as you know it might take some lengthy hours to complete, your brains feels the pain and you want to shift your attention from the pain, at least momentarily, to feel less pain. There you go, you procrastinate again.

#### Product and process
- Process: is the flow of time
- Product: is the outcome of your work
Your focus on the product triggers the pain in your brain, making you want to shift your attention away. Before starting a session, concentrate on the process of your work than the product of it.
![process product](https://media.images.yourquote.in/post/large/0/0/15/352/xBBV7426.jpg)
#### Self-motivating tricks 
Starting a task or learning session with a little negative emotion is alright, but it is about how to deal with it, you can tell yourself you will get over it 

#### Planner journal: Keep a "To do list" journal of your task 
- Do it a the night before 
So that you brain will starting working on the once you write it down in the background without you realizing it. Keeping all the to do list in your brains takes up space, will slow down your efficiency
- Focus on the process 
Focus on the process helps you overcome procrastinate, make you feel less
- Write only 6 items 
Otherwise you would also trigger the pain in your brain
- Set a quitting time
Life is not all about studying, you also need to give yourself a leisure time along with working time.

## Week 4 
#### Best gift to the bran
Exercise 

#### Language learning 
When the new language you are learning seems completely incomprehensible, that's probably because your brain is reconstructing the knowledge, and when you come back from this you would probably leap forward

#### Metaphor and analogy
Using metaphor and analogy helps understand concepts, not only in art and literature but also in hard science

#### Imposter syndrome 
Feeling of incompetence even when there is external proof.

#### Being intelligent 
Being intelligent is good but it would be hard to be creative at the same time
Do not have to envy the smart people, what you need to do is the deliberately practice the toughest subject and make it a habit

#### Learning advice
No matter you are excel in something or not, not everyone is warm hearted as you thing they are, people throw their opinions no matter you are doing great or not.

#### Principle in learning 
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool' -- Richard Feynman
![principale](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*Ne6HNQPT2m4OKWv9iCDejQ.jpeg)
#### Team works 
Team work helps spot your blind spots, better to review for test with your classmates 

#### Test
Testing is an extraordinary learning experience 

#### Excellent educator - [Richard Felder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Felder)

#### Test Checklist: Things you should do in order to excel in a test
Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
- Did you attempt to outline each homework question before discussing it with classmates?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
- Did you consult with the instructor/teach assistants when you were having trouble?
- Did you understand all of your homework problem solutions before the assignment was handed in?
- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problems that were unclear to you?
- If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you understood all of the material?
- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time doing the algebra?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?
- If there was a review session, did you attend and ask questions about any concepts or ideas that you were unsure of?
- Did you get a reasonable night’s sleep before the test?

![test taking techniques](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS613Ge86LMP0ZHr8ZkkzW5RqbgpTQlm12UNQ&usqp=CAU)
#### Test taking technique
- Start with the easy one or the hard one?
Many people may advise starting by the easy one and more to the harder questions when taking a test, so that you can build you confidence along the way, this works for some people as everything works for some people!

What Richard Felder advise is to start with the hard problem to set yourself in the focused mode to find solutions, here comes the important point of this technique ,AND when you get stuck on the same problem for more than 1 min or 2 then you need to pull yourself out from the difficult question to move on the easy question. WHY? By doing so, you help your brain switch from the focused mode to the diffuse mode, which is critical when creativity is needed to solve difficult questions. Your brain does not stop working on the difficult questions when your attention moves away, but rather diffused mode of thinking on the background is helps find solutions. AGAIN, what is difficult is to pull out yourself from the difficult problem set.

- How to fool yourself when you panic?
    - If you tell your self "This test has got me excited" rather than "It has made me afraid", your performance in the test would improve 
    - When you find yourself in panic, turn your attention from "OMG, it is freaking" -ish ideas to your breathing, yes, it is like meditation methods. But, how to do it?
        - Put your hand on your stomach, not on your chest, and take a deep breath, your hand should move outward helps you calm down. BUT practice doing so weeks before taking a test, rather than on the day of the test. 
- Other techniques
    - Cover the questions of the multiple questionnaire and try to answer them yourself first, recall the information 
    - On the day before the test or the tests, go through the material and brush up on your memory, which helps to better retrieve the information stored on your brain on the next day.
    - When reviewing the exam paper, try to go from the back to the front rather than from the front to the back helps spot the errors more easily  
    - Double-check, blink, go away from it and come back later to make sure that the answer makes perfect sense 
    - Get enough sleep before the test
